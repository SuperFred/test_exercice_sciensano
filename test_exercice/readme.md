# Answer

1. Module and entity created with drush generate content-entity
   - Form , permissions and template are generated by drush, they can be manually updated if necessary

2. Manually update id to teid

3. Manually add time field in time entity (/src/Entity/TimeEntry.php)

4. Module dependencies :
   1. migrate (core module)
   2. migrate_source_csv migrate_plus migrate_tools (contrib module)

5. Migrate config file in config/install folder

6. Example source file in sources folder

7. hook_install implemented to import csv on module install

8. See result in screenshot.png

# Drupal Test Exercise

1) Create a Drupal 9 module with:
    - A custom fieldable, revisionable, translatable *Content Entity* called **TimeEntry** (machine name: **time_entry**) + all necessary handlers, forms, permissions to support CRUD operations.
      The entity should contain the following *base fields* (+ any additional base fields to provide revisionable and translatable behaviour):
        - **teid** (integer)
        - **uuid** (uuid)
        - **title** (string)
        - **time** (integer)
        - **uid** (entity_reference to a user)
        - **created** (created)
        - **changed** (changed)
    - Migration configuration (*Migrate API*) to import sample time entry content from a CSV file
    - A theme + standard template file (**templates/time-entry.html.twig**) for the **TimeEntry**.
    - Ability to import of 10 sample time entries on module install (via migrate).
2) Publish your code in a separate public github repository
3) Share the link

## End Result
After installation of the module the following should be possible:
- Administrator should be able to see the list of time entries
- Administrator should be able to do CRUD on time entries
- Administrator should be able to add fields to the time entry

## Remarks
- Dependency on **entity_api** (https://www.drupal.org/project/entity) module is allowed to reduce unnecessary boilerplate code.
- Be as complete / verbose with the code / comments as you think is necessary.
- Follow established best-practices / conventions.
